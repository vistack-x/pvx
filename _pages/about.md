At vistack, we understand how to evolve efficiently. Vistack is a data driven,personal analytics venture aimed at changing the current scenario with a question to think about – is it possible to pursue data-driven decision making in our personal lives?


Back in 2012,Stephen Wolfram--the brain behind the Wolfram site, analysed his emails, keystrokes, phone calls, meetings, events, and walking habits which helped him to draw very meaningful insights. He called out that storing personal data at the minimum provides the benefit of “memory augmentation” – the ability to recollect events, incidents, and actions from data archives as an extension of one’s own memories.


We pride ourselves not only on our functionality, but our user-proof administration and user-proof configuration. Our technology takes the best aspects of Analytics and Data Science and combines to make an impact on your daily lives.
                                  
We live with the following motto:                 
                                  "Live in the future and build what seems interesting. " --Paul Graham
