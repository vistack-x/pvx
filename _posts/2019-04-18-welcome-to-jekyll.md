<!--You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.-->

That is a remarkable achievement taking into account the current and previous fiscal year's financial state of things! We apply the proverb "He who hesitates is lost" not only to our re-purposing but our capacity to repurpose.
