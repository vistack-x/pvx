1. Efficient “personal data analytics”,with focus on the human and humane face of data.

2. Drawing meaningful conclusions--fast and in a way that is easy for the end user.

3. Since personal data is involved--absolute trust has to be maintained between the end user and the venture.

4. Data Security has to be maintained and adhered to.
